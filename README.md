# KingNash
##Board/Strategy Game
I'm currently developing using NodeJs as an online multiplayer game.
<br/>A lot of featues are going tobe change with great interface and animations.

#A brief story:
Once upon a time, there were two kingdoms (A & B). They waged war between each other and try to conquer the other kingdom by Killing its King (K).
<br/> The main objective of this game is to kill the king and conquer the KingDom (A or B).
